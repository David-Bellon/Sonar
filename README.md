# Sonar
## Run this thing
To run this basically dowload the [pre.py](https://github.com/David-Bellon/Sonar/blob/main/pre.py), the [main.py](https://github.com/David-Bellon/Sonar/blob/main/main.py) and the [sonar-data.csv](https://github.com/David-Bellon/Sonar/blob/main/sonar-data.csv), the others are going to be created as you go.  
You put all those files in the same folder and then run the main.py. This will create two csv files and then if you want run the [ipynb](https://github.com/David-Bellon/Sonar/blob/main/sonar.ipynb) file wich should create almost the same output as in the given file.
## Analysis
If you only whant the analysis thing and the results just check the [ipynb file](https://github.com/David-Bellon/Sonar/blob/main/sonar.ipynb) where it shows al the info as well as the code of each cell.
