# Sonar
## Run this thing
To run this basically dowload the pre.py, the main.py and the sonar-data.csv, the others are going to be created as you going.  
You put all those files in the same folder and then run the main.py. This will create two csv files and then if you want run the ipynb file wich should create almost the same output.
